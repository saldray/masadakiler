To close the window, press Ctrl+B, and then quickly hit X. The status bar turns amber. You're then prompted to confirm you want to kill the window.

Press Y to close the window or N if you change your mind. You don't have to press Enter afterward; Y or N is enough to register your choice.

To start tmux with a session name, use the new (new session) command, and the -s (session name) option. Our session is going to be called "geek-1," so we type the following:

To create a new window in the current session, press Ctrl+B, and then C. You'll get a blank terminal window in the current session. So we'll have something running in this new window, let's start the dmesg command with the -w (follow) option:


To hop between windows, press Ctrl+B, and then one of the followings keys:

    N: Display the next window.
    P: Display the previous window.
    0 to 9: Display a window numbered 0 to 9.

You can also choose a window from a list. If you press Ctrl+B, and then W, a list of windows appears.



 Detaching and Attaching Sessions

If you press Ctrl+B, and then D, you will detach the session. It will continue to run in the background, but you won't be able to see or interact with it.

We've started top in the session so we have a running process to demonstrate with. Then, we press Ctrl+B, and then D. The session disappears and becomes a background session.


To attach a detached session, we'll use the self-explanatory attach-session command with the -t (target session) option. We'll also provide the name of the session we wish to recall.

We type the following:

tmux attach-session -t geek-1



 Working with Window Panes

If you press Ctrl+B, and then double quotation marks (""), you split the window horizontally into two panes.

Ctrl+B x close

If you press Ctrl+B, and then the percentage sign (%) it splits the current pane vertically.
